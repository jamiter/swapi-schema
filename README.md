# GraphQL schema for swapi.io

Installation:
```
npm install swapi-schema
```

Usage
```javascript
import { Schema } from 'swapi-schema';

// Whatever code you have that uses the schema.
```

The schema was directly copied from [this repository](https://github.com/apollostack/swapi-rest-graphql), so all credits go to [Sashko Stubailo](https://github.com/stubailo).

The reason for the copy was that I wanted to only use the schema without importing express or any other server logic.
